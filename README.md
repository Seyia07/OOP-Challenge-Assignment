# OOP Challenge Assignment

This repository contains my step-by-step solutions for an OOP assignment using Java. Each challenge is implemented in a separate Java file.
## Challenges
1. **Greeter Class:**  
   A class that takes a user name through the constructor and prints a greeting.
2. **Variable Class:**  
   Demonstrates encapsulation using a private variable with getter and setter methods.
3. **Choices (if, else if, else):**  
   Uses conditional logic to determine whether a number is positive, negative, or zero.
4. **Scanner Import:**  
   Shows how to import and use a Scanner to capture user input.
5. **While Loop:**  
   Uses a while loop and Scanner to repeatedly prompt the user until "exit" is entered.
